How to run the api's endpoint using a swagger

Running the application is easy, all you need to do is to download the folder from the repo to your local drive c or any location on your pc
 then run the BookStoreApi.sln from the downloaded file.
 
 then open the appsettings.json on the application and change the sql instance name to the one on your system then go manager console and type in the commpand
 to uodate database (update-database) to install all the migration
 
 after that you can run the application and it will display through swagger where u see all the endpoint then you can test
 
 thank you
